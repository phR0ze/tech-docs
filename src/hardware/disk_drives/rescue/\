## Overview

### TestDisk vs DDRescue
TestDisk was designed to work at the logical level i.e. repair partition issues while DDRescue was 
designed to work at the raw block level for damaged disks.

## TestDisk
[TestDisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a command line utility for data recovery. If 
you have lost a partition or have strange problems with your hard disk partitions run `testdisk` to 
recovery your data.

Supports all common disk formats including: `NTFS`, `FAT32`, and `ext4`

## DDRescue
GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or block device (hard disc, cdrom, 
etc) to another, trying to rescue the good parts first in case of read errors.
