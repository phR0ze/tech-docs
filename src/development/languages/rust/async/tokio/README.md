Tokio is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. It provides the building blocks 
needed for writing network applications. It gives the flexibility to target a wide range of systems, 
from large servers with dozens of cores to small embedded devices. Used by `AWS`, `Discord`, `Azure`, 
`Linkerd`, `Facebook` and others.

The Tokio stack includes a number of individual components to make async application building easier.

## Runtime
Including I/O, timer, filesystem, synchronization, and scheduling facilities, the Tokio runtime is 
the foundation of asynchronous applications.

## Hyper
An HTTP client and server library supporting both the HTTP 1 and 2 protocols.

## Tonic
A boilerplate-free gRPC client and server library. The easiest way to expose and consume an API over 
the network.

## Tower
Modular components for building reliable clients and servers. Includes retry, load-balancing, 
filtering, request-limiting facilities, and more.

## Mio
Minimal portable API on top of the operating-system's evented I/O API.

## Tracing
Unified insight into the application and libraries. Provides structured, event-based, data collection 
and logging.

## Bytes
At the core, networking applications manipulate byte streams. Bytes provides a rich set of utilities 
for manipulating byte arrays.
