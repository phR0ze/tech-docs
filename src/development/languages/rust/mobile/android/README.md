# Android

Researching Rust on Android. I'd really like to see a full Rust app on Android.

## Tooling

### Winit
Cross-platform Window handling library in pure Rust. Consumes the `android-activity` for 
crossplatform windowing.

**Notes**
* Create windows
* Handle events like window resizing, key presses, mouse movement
* Depends on platform-specific providers for showing something on the screen
* X11 and Wayland support
* Don't specify dependencies allow winit to do it for you
  * Instead consume the API re-exported by winit at `winit::platform::android::activity::*`

**Android**
* Android backend builds and exposes types from the ndk crate

### android-activity
`android-activity` provides a way to load your crate as a `cdylib` library via the `onCreate` method 
of your Android Activity class; run an `android_main()` function in a separate thread from the Java 
main thread and marshal events (such as lifecycle events and input events) between Java and your 
native thread.

This is a refactored continuation of the [ndk](#ndk) work from the rust-mobile community. This 
encapsulates the former work done in the `ndk`, `ndk-glue`, `ndk-macro` projects.

Android apps are not like your average commandline executable, instead they are always associated 
with a physical window, a so called ***Activity*** in Android terminology. The `NativeActivity` loads 
your Rust code and is where it resides, allowing apps to be created without any Java code/classes at 
all. It serves as a bridge between Android's app lifecycle and your Rust code forwarding events 
through callbacks. This integration defines how an app starts up and moves to back and foreground 
while users navigate their phone.

**Refrences**
* [Android activity github](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity)
* [Android game activity](https://developer.android.com/games/agdk/game-activity)

**Features**
* `GameActivity` - new `Jetpack library` and recommended path
  * GameActivity inherits from the NativeActivity also from the JetPack `AppCompatActivity`
  * Allows for seamless use of other Jepack components like `ActionBar` and `Fragment`
  * Renders to the `SurfaceView` making it easier for games to interact with other UI components
  * GameActivity apps are expected to build all three parts of of the app into one library
* `NativeActivity` - deprecated older integration

### xbuild
Rust cross compile automation assistance for mobile. Supports Rust native and Flutter

Note: if you get a `error: failed to run custom build command for glib-sys v0.14.0` you need to 
install the `gtk3-dev` package.

1. Install
   ```bash
   $ cargo install xbuild
   ```
2. Rust doctor will examine your system and check for missing tools
   ```bash
   $ x doctor

## Retained UI

### Dioxus
Mobile is currently the least-supported renderer target for Dioxus. Mobile apps are rendered with 
either the platform's WebView or experimentally with Blitz WGPU renderer.

**References**
* [iOS mobile example](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/example-projects/tree/master/ios_demo)
* [xbuild Dioxus](https://altimetrikpoland.medium.com/writing-multi-platform-gui-app-in-rust-f54aba3e97b8)

* Looking for contributers
* Currently only iOS is officially supported
* Blitz WGPU renderer via Vello
  * CSS is handled via lightningcss
  * Layout is handled with Taffy

### Slint
Has some initial work and toy apps but not ready for prime tine

* Uses the `skia` renderer for GPU acceleration and native looking text rendering
* 

### Flutter RS
