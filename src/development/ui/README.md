Developing native apps for each of your target platforms is tedious, error prone, expensive and labor 
intensive. There are separate codebases, separate teams, separate maintenance etc... Cross-platform
development seeks to solve this by having as much overlap as possible between the code for the 
different platforms.

Typically the solutions come down to two types: Web technology based on Progressive web apps (PWAs) 
with HTML and CSS or native code written in a single language. However a third option is emmerging 
with Flutter in that the UI is cross-platform in one language while the backend is cross-platform in 
another. RustDesk is a good example of this.
