# Cross-platform
Developing native apps for each of your target platforms is tedious, error prone, expensive and labor 
intensive. There are separate codebases, separate teams separate maintenance etc... Cross-platform
development seeks to solve this by having as much overlap as possible between the code for the 
different platforms.

Typically the solutions come down to two types:
1. Web technology based
   * Progressive web apps (PWAs)
   * DOM based apps using HTML and CSS and built in web engines
2. Native code based
   * Written in a single language
