# Fluent UI
Flutter offers the Cuppertino and Material App widget sets for developing IOS and Android apps with 
a look and feel that mimics the native platform. The [Fluent UI](https://pub.dev/packages/fluent_ui) 
package, although 3rd party, is recommended by the Flutter team and marked as a flutter favorite with 
the express intent of building ***"an app that matches the conventions of Microsoft's Fluent design 
system"***. Microsoft even directly offers the [Fluent UI System Icons](https://pub.dev/packages/fluentui_system_icons)
for this purpose as well. Finally the [bitsdogo window](https://pub.dev/packages/bitsdojo_window) 
provides support for *owner drawn* title bars, allowing you to replace the standard Windows title bar 
with a custom one that matches the rest of your app.

Using these two packages together you'll find support for visuals and controls that are commonly 
found in modern Windows apps, including navigation views, content dialogs, flyouts, date pickers, and 
tree view widgets.
