## Branches

### Delete Branch

* Delete Local Branch
  ```bash
  $ git branch -d <branch>
  ```

* Delete Remote Branch
  ```bash
  $ git push origin -d <branch>
  ```

### Push Branch

* Push to Different Name
Call out the remote first then the branch names `<local-name>:<remote-name>`

```bash
# Push local working to upstream/master
$ git push upstream working:master

# Push local master to upstream/fix
$ git push upstream master:fix
```

## Clone

* Clone a specific branch
  ```bash
  $ git clone --single-branch -b <branchname> <remote-repo>
  ```

## Cherry Pick
Git cherry-pick allows you to merg in a single commit from one branch to another.

```bash
$ git cherry-pick <HASH>
```

## Diff

### Diff Branches
```bash
$ git diff v1.0.0..v1.0.1
```

### Diff Name Only
```bash
$ git diff HEAD^ --name-only
```

* Diff Name Only with Excludes
You can exclude files from a diff with the `:(exclude)<pattern>` syntax.

```bash
# git diff HEAD~20 --name-only -- . ':(exclude)<pattern>'
$ git diff HEAD~20 --name-only -- . ':(exclude)vendor/*'
.gitignore
.vscode/launch.json
Gopkg.lock
Gopkg.toml
Makefile
README.md
VERSION
go.mod
go.sum
```

### Diff Specific Dir
```bash
$ git diff HEAD^ --name-only /dir/to/filter/on
```

### Diff Two Commits
```bash
$ git diff 176aaaaf fecb1299 --name-only
```

## Hooks

### Set Local
Often we'll want custom hooks to run after commits to auto incrementa a version number or something.
To do this create the hooks in your repo at `.githooks` then configure your repo to use the hooks.

```bash
# Change to your project root
cd ~/Projects/cyberlinux

# Set hooks to be used locally from your repo
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Reauthor

### Reauthor Range
1. Identify the last good commit:
   ```bash
   $ git log -5 --oneline
   31ce85f31 (HEAD -> staging) Patch nil reference bug
   6d74d628e Adding new Dockerfile and cleaning up README and Makefile
   d490c85c4 Versioning vendored packages
   038bad502 Simplifying root dir
   89bd14c15 (tag: v2.16.5, origin/release-2.16) Fixing validation issue
   ```
2. Invoke an interactive rebase and change all entries to `edit`:
   ```bash
   $ git rebase -i -p 89bd14c15
   ```
3. Each time rebase stops:
   ```bash
   $ git commit --amend --author="user <user@example.com>" --no-edit
   $ git rebase --continue
   ```

## Rebase
### Squash
```bash
# Squash the last 78 commits into a single commit
$ git rebase -i HEAD~78
```

## Remotes

### Add Remote
```bash
# syntax: git remote add <name> <url>
$ git remote add origin ssh://user@ip-address/root/path/to/project
```

### Rename Remote
```bash
# syntax: git remote rename <old> <new>
$ git remote rename origin upstream
```

## Resolve Conflicts
This can happen when your merging, rebasing or cherry-picking commits

```bash
# Run status to see conflicts
$ git status
On branch istio
Your branch is up to date with 'upstream/master'.

You are currently cherry-picking commit 3dc0eb85.
  (fix conflicts and run "git cherry-pick --continue")
  (use "git cherry-pick --abort" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)

Changes to be committed:
	modified:   project1/templates/deployment.yaml

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
	both modified:   project1/templates/cronjobs.yaml
	both modified:   project1/templates/db-migrate.yaml
	deleted by them: project1/templates/foo.yaml

# Now deal with them
# Manually: alias gf='vim `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=M | uniq`'
# Note in this context HEAD the new stuff your merging in
$ gf

# Mark them resolved
$ git add .

# Continue
$ git cherry-pick --continue
```

## Tags

### Checkout a Tag
```bash
$ git checkout -b <my branch> tags/<my tag>
```

### Delete All Tags

Delete all local tags
```bash
$ git tag -d $(git tag -l)
```

Fetch all remote tags
```bash
$ git fetch
```

Delete all remove tags
```bash
$ git push origin --delete $(git tag -l)
```

Delete all local tags
```bash
$ git tag -d $(git tag -l)
```

### Delete Matching Tags

Delete all matching local tags
```bash
# Deletes all local tags starting with 'v1'
$ git tag -d $(git tag -l "v1*")
```

Delete all matching remote tags
```bash
$ git push origin --delete $(git tag -l)
```
