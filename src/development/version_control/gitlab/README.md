## Overview
Gitlab claims to be the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps platform.

* Planning
* Coding
* Building and deploying
* Securing and Monitoring

## GitLab Duo
Gitlab aims to apploy AI throughout the Software Delivery Lifecycle while providing privacy and 
transparency. They say your code stays your code and they will not use it for training or fine tuning 
of AI models.

GitLab Duo is a suite of AI powered features:
* Planning refinement
* Pair programming
* Vulnerability resolution
* Deploy more effectively
* CI/CD pipeline health assistant
* Analytics charting helper

### GitLab Duo Code suggestions
Built on top of the `PaLM 2 Codey` models from Vertex AI providing integration with VSCode and NeoVim 
with features similar to Copilot. Similar privacy posture as Copilot i.e. your source code will not 
be used to train the model.

Available right now for free to any GitLab user while in Beta.
