### SPACE

### DORA metrics
Pioneered by book `Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software` and `DevOps: Building and Scaling High 
Performing Technology Organizations` the four key metrics of the Software Development Lifecycle are:
1 ***Cycle Time*** - Time to implement, test, review and deliver
2 ***Deploy Velocity*** - Number of deployments in a given duration of time
3 ***Change Failure Rate (CFR)*** - Percentage of deployments which caused a failure in production
4 ***Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)*** - Mean time it takes to restore service after production failure

### Shift left
Move the testing aspects of the lifecycle upstream to the developers.

### Shift down
Move more toil onto the platform automation off from the developer
