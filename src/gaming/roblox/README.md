Roblox, created in 2006, is a platform for many different types of games and experiences. You can 
create or consume games on the platform. Robux is a way to spend and earn real currancy on the 
platform. You interact with the Roblox platform via your avatar which appears in the games and 
experiences you play or interact with. You can earn items to customize your avatar or spend currancy 
to buy them.

## Installation
NixOS is not officially supported by Roblox however there are a few different packages that can be 
installed for NixOS to provide third party support for Roblox with mixed success.

### Waydroid
***Waydroid*** runs the Android version of Roblox in a containerized environment with the community 
reporting some success

### Sober
***Sober*** is another Android based solution which wraps Roblox 

### Wine approaches failed
***Wine*** + ***Grapejuice*** or ***Vinegar*** are not reliable as Roblox has deliberately blocked 
Wine-based solutions due to claims of anti-cheat concerns. Community feedback confirms that by early 
2024 Roblox stopped working via Wine based methods.
