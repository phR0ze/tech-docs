Cryptocurrency a.k.a. crypto is digital currency designed to work through a computer network. 
Traditionally it wasn't reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or 
maintain it until recently with the advent of stablecoin.

## Overview

### Anonymity
The perception that cryptocurrencies are anonymous is completely false. Traditionally cryptocurrency 
is way more transparent and open as to who did what and when than any other currency. All 
transactions are recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain. Law enforcement use this public 
trail of purchases as evidence all the time.

## Monero
Monero (XMR) is an open source cryptocurrency, based on CrytoNote v2, that was designed to be 
private and untraceable. In practice those there is little privacy at all given the movement in and 
out of the currency from Bitcoin and correlational data around purchases.

### Tradeoff for anonymity
Monero accomplishes this by bloating the blockchain which is a cost for decentrailization of the 
nodes and caps the cryptocurrency at $2.8 billion. This artificially limits the growth of this flavor 
of cryptocurrency as it becomes unweildy to download and work with the blockchain. Monero is known by 
some as a [hot potato currency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LTT7wwyUAQ) because its constantly 
loosing value in relationship to Bitcoin (BTC). So if you use it you'll want to swap from Bitcoin and spend 
it fast before it looses value. However the merchant that is accepting it will also be converting it 
directly back into Bitcoin and your privacy is thus blown by the obvious correlation between the 
amounts and times.

### Swap from Bitcoin
The recommended approach is to buy Bitcoin (BTC) then swap to Monero through services like cake 
wallet.

Purchasing VISA gift cards can be done with cash up to a certain amount.
