Auth0 is the de facto standard for modern IAM solutions. Since its founding in 2013 literally dozens
of startup clones have entered the market attempting to copy its model and functionality.
Auth0 is by far the most well known option in the modern Identity & Access Management space. Because
of Auth0 amazing success they were acquired by Okta in 2022 and has since been subsumed into Okta’s
sales, support, and customer service machine. 

Auth0 has the two edged sword of leading the market. They rolled out the most comprehensive B2B2C
SaaS app solution before anyone else. This means that other solutions were able to learn from their
mistakes and are trying to leapfrog them. Likely this would have never happened except they were
acquired by Okta and big tech has slowed them down and changed their focus. As a result there are
some real options among the clone competition.
