# IAM <img style="margin: 6px 13px 0px 0px" align="left" src="../data/images/logo_36x36.png" />

An Identity and Access Management (IAM) provider is a system that ensures secure, controlled, easy 
access to resources.

## Overview

**References**
* [IAM - medium](https://logto.medium.com/top-5-open-source-identity-and-access-management-iam-providers-2025-ef2428c01c6e)
* [Awesome IAM Knowledge docs](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-iam)

IAM is composed of the following segments:
* `Governance`
  * `User Management`
    - provisioning
    - roles
    - audits
    - measuring the time and resources users use
  * `Organizational Management`
    - structuring teams
    - multitenancy

* `Authentication (Authn)`
  - establish who you are
  - Logins, passwords, biometrics, social login
  - Something you know and something you have (token)

* `Authorization (Authz)`
  - establish what you can do
  - Roles
  - permissions for resources

* `Audit`
  - Audit trails of user activity

### Auth0 case study
***Auth0***, founded in 2013, is the defacto standard for modern B2B2C SaaS IAM solutions that every 
startup is comparing themselves to. It is by far the most well known option in teh modern IAM space. 
So much so that Auth0 was acquired by Okta in 2022 and has since been subsumed into Okta's processes 
and lost its original developer focused flare.

Other notable paid clones include:
* ***Frontegg***, ***FusionAuth***, ***Descope***, ***WorkOS***, ***Stytch***, and ***SSOJet***

All the paid clones and many open source projects have tried to clone or are heavily inspired by 
Auth0, which makes it an interesting case study. What is it that Auth0 did that was so successful? 
Auth0 provided a B2B2C SaaS model that fits well with modern application design.

They built an intuitive API and Web portal to manage the IAM

### Interface design

You have a similar management interface with control options on the left 
such as `Applications`, `Authentication`, `Organizations`, `User Management`, `Branding`, `Security`, 
`Actions`, `Auth Pipeline`, `Monitoring`, `Marketplace`, `Extensions` and `Settings`

  * ***Access Control***
    - MAC (Mandatory Access Control)
    - DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
    - RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
  * ***RBAC*** - give permissions based on role
  * ***Federation*** - a collection of domains that have established trust
  * ***Least priviledge*** - minimum necessary permission to do job
  * ***Provisioning*** - is the act of creating, updating, and deleting information for user
  * ***Conditional Access*** - provided when needed
  * ***Just-in-Time Access*** - provide access for a window of time
* Identity Provider
Identity providers execute authentication. IdP can create store and management identities. A user 
will send credentials to the IdP and the IdP will send back a token.

1. Service Provider sends token request to Identity Provider
2. Identity Provider will then send back a token to be passed through

**Common IdPs**
* Facebook
* Google
* Auth0
* AWS
* Okta

* Identity Governance
A process for manageing access to resources via a centralized solution. The Identity Governance 
Process confirms authentication process has taken place by checking the user's token that was 
provided by the IdP.

## Workfoce IdPs

### Single Sing-On SSO
The ability to sign on a single time for multiple services.

Federated Identity Management (FIM) is accomplished through 3 primary protocols:

**Protocols**

* ***SAML*** - Security Assertion Markup Language
  * Verable, widely used, xml based and old

* ***OAuth2.0*** - requests authentication without sharing passwords
  * JSON based token sharing, modern
  * Shares just the token

* ***OIDC*** - OpenID Connect
  * Protocol that extends OAuth2.0 with additional functions
  * Adds the ability to share account data like user profile

* ***SCIM*** - 

### Key considerations
* Authentication (Connectors)
  - Password
  - SSO (OAuth2, OIDC, SAM)
    - Okta, Azure, Google
  - Personal access tokens
  - OAuth consent flows
  - Email and SMS passwordless
  - Social logins: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Github, X.com, LInkedIn,
  - Biometric
  - Machine to Machine (M2M)
* Authorization (Roles)
  - User/Organizational RBAC
  - ABAC
  - JWT/opaque token validation
  - API protection
* User Management
  - Users
    - Create
    - Reset
    - Member invitations
    - User migration
    - JIT user provisioning
    - Impersonation
    - Suspend
  - Organizations
    - User federation
    - Multi-tenancy
    - Structured teams
* Security and Management
  - MFA (TOTP, Email, SMS, backup codes)
    - Email: AWS, Mailgun, Postmark, SendGrid
  - Audit logs
    - measuring time and resources used
  - Webhooks
  - Compliance reporting
  - Encryption
  - Policy
  - Brute-force protection
  - Bot detection
  - Blocklists
  - SOC2/GDPR
* User experience
  - prebuilt auth flows (login, registration, password reset)
  - intuitive user flows
  - mobile friendly
  - customizable
* Developer experience
  * Customization and extensibility
    - ui themes
    - styling and colors
  - SDKs and Deployment flexibility
  - comprehensive docs
  - code samples
  - sandbox environments
  - low-code admin consoles
  - thriving dev community (discord, github)
  - enterprise support options
  - regular updates for zero-day vulnerabilities

## Self-hosted options
IAM solutions in this space sit in front of NextCloud, Grafana and other self hosted apps providing 
authentication and authorization. They add login, 2FA, access controls and other options but take 
different approaches.

| Feature         | Authelia          | Authentik           | 
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | 
| UI              | No                | Typescript          |
| MFA             | TOTP, WebAuthn    | TOTP, WebAuthn      |
| Resource Usage  | 30Mb RAM, 0.5 CPU | 2GB Ram, 2 CPU      |
| Setup           |                   |                     |
| Protocols       | LDAP, OIDC        | OAuth2/OIDC, SAML2, SCIM |

### Golang
`Golang` seems to dominate the open source IAM space with 3 of the top contenders being written in 
Golang. Typescript, Java and Python all have a single offering each as well.
