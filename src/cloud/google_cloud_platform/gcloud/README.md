# gcloud
gcloud is a python application for interacting with the Google Cloud Platform. Given that its Python 
is is slow, takes up ~100MB of disk space, is annoying to install in CI/CD and depends on specific 
Python versions in some cases.

## Golang Implementation
[garnera's gcloud](https://github.com/gartnera/gcloud) is a Golang implementation of some of the 
gcloud functionality and gives an interesting view into how to implement your own gcloud alternatives 
to certain functionality.
