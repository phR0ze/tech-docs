## Hyperscaler
Hyperscalers are large cloud service providers that can provide services such as computing and 
storage at enterprise scale. While there is no universal standard for what should be classified as a 
hyperscaler, major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM 
Cloud and Alibaba Cloud fit the description.
