## Tabbed
Provides the ability to add tabs to an application that wouldn't have tabs otherwise. Following the 
suckless philosophy tabbed provides tabbing for all rather than having each application build in 
their own tabbing capabilities.

Tabbed adds a generic tabbed frontend to xembed aware applictions.
