# Distro comparison
Reviewing the various Linux distros that have caught my eye and the components they are composed
from.

All of the Distros below are being reviewed in a VirtualBox VM with 4GB of RAM and (2)
`Intel E5-2637 Cores`. Obviously this will be highly subjective and serves more as a reference for
myself.

## Hefftor Linux
[Hefftor Linux](https://hefftorlinux.net/) popped up on my radar when I was searching for a better
lock screen. Apparently Brad Hefferman made his own GUI tool for the `Betterlockscreen` scripts which
got me curious about what hes was working on. His screen shots look really neat.

**Review**
* On first boot your presented with a similar looking menu to the original Arch Linux ISO.
* It boots into a full featured Live environment and runs the Calamares installer
  * The Calamares installer is clean and slick looking
* There is a nice compositing translucent affect that windows get when you move them
* The default theme and look and feel are subdued and pleasant
* Conky date and time in a neat font on desktop
* Terminal - URXVT with no scrollbar and higher than usual tranparencey
* xfce4-panel top right for tray icons
* App launcher - Plank at bottom
* XFW4 Window Manager 
* pavucontrol - launched from 
* risretto image viewer
* catfish file search
* grsync ui for rsync
* yad icon browser
* Fonts via XFC Appearance
