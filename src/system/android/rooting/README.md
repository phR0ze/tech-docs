### SafetyNet Fix
[kdrag0n's safetynet-fix](https://github.com/kdrag0n/safetynet-fix) leverages Magisk's modules to

work that normally would fail on rooted devices.

2. Navigate to `Settings`
   1. Choose `Hide Magisk app`
   2. Enable `Zygisk`
   3. Enable `Enforce DenyList`
   4. Select `Configure DenyList` and add all apps that would normally fail on rooted devices
3. Navigate to Modules
   1. Install `Systemless Hosts`
   2. Install `Universal SafetyFix` v2.4.0 or newer by `kdrag0n`
