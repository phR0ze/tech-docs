# Display Servers
Xorg and Wayland are the main stream display server protocols used in Linux to manage graphical 
displays. Xorg a.k.a X11 has been the defacto standard forever. As the technology landscape has 
evolved Xorg's original design has been unable to keep up. Thus Waylang was created as a modern 
display server protocol, which addresses the shortcomings and inefficiencies of Xorg.
