Jellyfin is an open source media management and playback system for movies, shows, music, books and 
photos. It is a server client architecture with support for live transcoding to ensure your media 
always looks good on the target device. Jellyfin is competing with Plex in this arena, which is more 
established and has a paid option. That said Jellyfin is close to feature parity.
