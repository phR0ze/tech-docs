I'm looking to find a self-hosting private photo/video solution for my family media. The solution 
needs to provides functionality on par with Google Photos with some additional benefits:
* Self-hosting for privacy and control
* OpenSource for extensibility and longevity
* Mobile support with backup
* Shared group space for the family
