Containers aim to alleviate the ***runs on my machine*** problem that developers face. ***Flatpak***, 
***AppImage*** and ***Snaps*** are ***universal packages*** and aim to solve this problem as well. 
Although they are both solving the same problem they don't necessarily use the same technologies 
despite behaving in a similar way. Universal apps are not tied to the underlying linux distro's 
package manager and can run on any distro that supports universal packages.

Snaps are slower than AppImage and Flatpak while Flatpak and AppImage are about the same with 
AppImage being slightly faster. Generally Snaps have a negative acceptance in the community due to 
the Snap store being carefully controlled by Canonical and automatically upgrading your packages i.e. 
reduced user control.

# Flatpak Overview
[Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) provides the ability to have Linux apps that run anywhere by
including the applications dependencies with the application. It also runs them in a sandboxed 
isolated environment that makes them more secure.
