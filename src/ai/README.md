# Overview
AI is predicted to be a golden age of innovation.
* AI will touch every business in every sector
* Google is investing BIG across everything with its new [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)

## AI Halucinations
AI has been plagued with what they call AI halucinations, in that you haven't been able to trust the 
answers you get back from AI from an accuracy or safety perspective. Often generative AI will just 
make up answers.

Google is looking to change this with large currated specialized datasets.

## LLMs
Large language models can be summed up as:
  * ML algorithms that can recognize, predict, and generate human languages
  * Pre-trained on petabyte scale datasets of text, images, video, chat, audio etc...

## Gen AI

### Vertex AI
Vertex AI is an enterprise ready generative AI. It allows you to take a snapshot of the Google LLMs 
and train and work with it in your own secure private space without leaking your information back to 
the whole.

* Vertex platform is where all your AI needs run
* You leverage Vertex AI for your own AI tools
* GKE Enterprise "new offering" for AI training performance
  * Mix of GPUs (A3 nvidia) and TPUs
* Vertex Model Garden
  * Ability to add third party models for use as well
  * Llama 2 and Claude 2 (third party) along side PaLM API for text (first party)
  * Code Llama
  * Imagen
  * Vertex AI Search and Conversation
* New AI tools based on Vertex AI for generating applications for your use cases
    * Simply describe the requirements and AI builds it for you

### Codey
Code generation on Vertex AI

  * Gitlabs is using this

### Imagen
Image generation on Vertex AI

  * Provides Digital Watermarking for AI generated images in a way that is invisiable to the human eye
  * Verification tools can be used to search for water marks to see if was generated by AI


### Notes
* Duet AI
  * AppSheet for Google Chat
    * "I need to capture incident reports. Each incident has a type, a status, a description, and a 
    date. Each incident should be assigned to a team member"
    * "Type should be major or minor"
    * Create App
  * Unstructured audio capture with Duet AI
  * Generate code
    * Describe code to be generated
    * Select generated code and say "write unit tests"

* Cloud Run Jobs
  * Run to completion capability for background work
  * It hides all the infra complexity (serverless)
  * When not running, costs nothing (serverless)

* Complexity for shipping code
  * How many engineers are required for a simple boolean change?
  * How long does it take to build and deploy?
  * Solve by empowering vertical and horizontal ownership
  * Building extensible but shared infrastructure
    * One over everything: one workload identity, one network, one ...
  * Use open source tools and APIs where possible
  * Platform and product architecture enables development and release velocity whether it's through 
  pluggability or portability or use of shared services our goal is to deliver the best functionality 

* `Cloud Build` and `Cloud Deploy` for CI and CD
  * Just added console UI support showing pipelines
  * Promoting images in UI, canary deployments etc...
  * How to application respond to scaling events
  * Infra is easy to maintain to spend more time adding value than keeping the lights on
  * Cloud Run performance 1 always running instance, CPU boost
  * Assured OSS checks

* Secure Software Supply Chain (S3C)
  * How are we securing out developer env
  * How are we ensuring the integrity of the build process

* Cloud Workstations
  * vscode in the browser
  * Cloud Build UI
