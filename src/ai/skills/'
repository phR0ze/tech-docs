Agent Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality. Each Skill packages
instructions, metadata, and optional resources (scripts, templates) that Claude uses automatically
when relevant. The key benefits are:
* Specialize Claude's focus
* Reusable prompts with handy slash command or by agents
* Composable in a chain

## Overview
Skills much like the majority of AI orchestration is all natual language based. This can be
unsettling and disorienting for those coming from a programming backtground where everything is very
prescriptive. Skills are composed of two documents:
1. YAML `frontmatter` document - composed of predefined fields for skill discovery
2. Markdown `prompt` document - composed of free form markdown describing the skill

### Frontmatter
The frontmatter yaml document at the top of the skill section does in fact use defined static field
names for skill discovery.

| Field          | Purpose                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| name           | Creates the /rust-review slash command           |
| description    | Lets Claude auto-invoke the skill when relevant  |
| argument-hint  | Shows expected args in autocomplete              |
| allowed-tools  | Tools usable without permission prompts          |
| user-invocable | Set false to hide from / menu (default: true)    |
| context: fork  | Run in an isolated subagent (read-only)          |
| model          | Override model (e.g., opus)                      |

### Prompt
The prompt or body of the skill is natural language used to describe the procedural knowledge,
workflows, best practices and general instructions used to carry out the desired operation. It is
organized as a markdown document with natural language free form headers that you specify to attach
meaning to your intent. This means there are no predefined headers or value to use other than a few
general purpose ones:
* Using the inline code space `foobar` will draw the AI's attention to an element and can be used to:
  * suggest a link back to a header
  * refer to other skills
  * refer to documents
* `IMPORTANT:` without the backticks is used to require the AI follow an instruction line

## Markdown
Turns out this skill is able to convert from images or other formats as well into nicely formatted markdown.

```md
---
name: markdown
description: Convert text to raw markdown. Use when asked to "/markdown", "convert to markdown", or "format as markdown".
version: 1.0.0
---

# Purpose
Convert text to markdown

# Constraints
* Output raw markdown inside a fenced code block (```markdown ... ```).
* Do not add trailing whitespace on any line.

## Tables
* Align all pipe characters with padding.
* Include a dashed header separator row.
```

## Review Rust
```md
---
name: rust-review
description: Review Rust code for correctness, performance, idioms, and safety.
argument-hint: [file-or-path]
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash(cargo *)
---

# Rust Code Review

Review the provided Rust code: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Criteria

### Correctness
- Proper error handling, lifetimes, and ownership
- No unnecessary unsafe blocks

### Performance
- Avoid unnecessary allocations and clones
- Appropriate algorithmic complexity

### Idiomatic Style
- Rust naming conventions (snake_case, PascalCase)
- Prefer pattern matching, Result/Option over exceptions-style code

### Safety
- Justified unwrap()/expect() calls
- Bounds checking

## Output Format

- **Summary**: 1-2 sentence assessment
- **Issues**: Critical problems first
- **Suggestions**: Concrete improvements with code examples
```

## Prime context
```md
---
description: Load context for a new agent session by analyzing codebase structure and README
allowed-tools: Bash, Read
---

# Prime
This command loads essential context for a new agent session by examining the codebase structure and
reading the project README.

## Instructions

- Run `git ls-files` to understand the codebase structure and file organization
- Read the README.md to understand the project purpose, setup instructions, and key information
- Provide a concise overview of the project based on the gathered context

## Context

- Codebase structure git accessible: !`git ls-files`
- Codebase structure all: !`eza . --tree`
- Project README: @README.md
- Documentation:
  - @.ai/cc_hooks_docs.md
  - @.ai/uv-single-file-scripts.md

When you finish run the tts summary agent, and let the user know you are done.
